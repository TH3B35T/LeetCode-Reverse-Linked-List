# LeetCode-Reverse-Linked-List

## Description
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

 

## Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
 ```

## Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the list is the range [0, 5000].
* -5000 <= Node.val <= 5000
 

Follow up: A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?
